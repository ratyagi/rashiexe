About me

As a passionate and driven individual with a strong interest in the machine learning and data science field, I am excited to take on new challenges and apply my skills and expertise in a dynamic and fast-paced environment. With a background in mathematics and computer science, I have developed a deep understanding of data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning algorithms. I have also gained experience in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, and have worked with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

In addition to my technical skills, I have also honed my leadership abilities through various roles in my academic and professional careers. I have led teams of developers on projects that required strong communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. I plan to earn a master's degree in near future. I am eager to bring my technical expertise and leadership skills to a challenging and rewarding role in the machine learning and data science field. If you are looking for a passionate and driven individual who can contribute to your team's success, please don't hesitate to reach out.
